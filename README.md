# Mall-Analysis-using-Postgresql
## I generated hypothetical questions that clients would ask if they were interested in building a mall. 
## Granted, the mall Kaggle dataset was limited, but I solved  some business questions with it.
## In my analysis I found that the country with the highest number of malls is the Philippines.
## It seems that the Philippines has the highest share of malls in the world but why?
## Compared to the rest of the countries the Philippines has a smaller land mass than the US and China. 
## The reason that keeps popping up is that the Philippines has a hot and humid climate. 
## Therefore it makes sense to build malls for people to chill when the temperature goes up.
